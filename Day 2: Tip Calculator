#Tip Calculator
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.
#Print welcome message
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

#Ask for bill total and convert input to float/decimal
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))

#Ask for tip amount and convert input to integer/whole number
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 5, 10, 12, 15, or 20? (Please don't add the percent sign) "))

#Ask how many people will split the bill and convert input to integer/whole number
num_of_people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

#Calculate bill with tip
tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount

#Divide total_bill by the number of people paying
bill_per_person = total_bill / num_of_people

#Round to two decimal places
final_bill = "{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)

#Add final bill to a variable and print the variable
final_bill_message = (f"Each person should pay: ${final_bill}")
print(final_bill_message)
